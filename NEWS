0.5.0:

* Ported to gtkmm 2.4.
* More HIG-compliant UI.

0.4.0:

* Now uses gnome-vfsmm, so any URI should work,
  not just directories on the local file system.
* There is now a progress bar.
* It now shows dialogs if incorrect data has 
  been entered, and if there are runtime failures.

0.3.0:

* Updated for latest Bakery API, 
  which no longer depends on gnomemm.
* Some UI improvement.
